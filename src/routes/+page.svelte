			I've most recently worked as a Research Assistant
			at the Security & Privacy Research Lab
			of UT Arlington, from May 2024 to December 2024.
			My main interests mainly revolve in low-level programming,
			including compiler design, programming languages, operating
			systems, and graphics programming.
		</p>
		<p>
			Besides programming, I've enjoyed fine arts since I was a child,
			and hope to one day work in a field where I can combine both,
			such as a developer for a video game and/or video game engine.
